# Hello there. I’m Levi Nunnink. 👋

I’m a working-class hacker living in Northern California. You can see my code here on GitHub and my attempts at design on Dribbble. I behave professionally on  LinkedIn, I get deep on  Medium, and I keep things friendly on  Twitter. I’ve been building for macOS and iOS for 10 years and I’ve been building products for the web since 2001. 👴🏻
